## Game Systems

### Character Progression
- Start at Level 1 with basic stats
- Gain XP through combat, quests, and exploration
- Level up to increase health, mana, and stamina
- Allocate skill points across different skill trees
- Customize character attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, etc.)

### Combat System
- Real-time action combat
- Health, mana, and stamina management
- Multiple weapon types and combat styles
- Stealth mechanics for avoiding combat

### World Systems
- Dynamic weather affecting gameplay
- Day/night cycle with different events and NPCs

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe game logic and systems
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics rendering and scene management
- **Vite**: Fast development and build tooling
- **WebGL**: Hardware-accelerated 3D graphics

### System Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each game system is independent and extensible
- **Event-Driven**: Communication between systems via event emitters
- **Save System**: JSON-based game state serialization
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering and update loops

## Live Demo

ðŸŽ® **[Play Copilot RPG](https://jikaheimo.github.io/copilot-rpg/)**

The game is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Development

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run code linting
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix linting issues automatically
- `npm run test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode  
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- `npm run test:ci` - Run tests in CI mode with coverage

### Testing
The project includes comprehensive unit tests covering core game systems:

- **GameState**: 28 tests covering state management, inventory, quests, leveling, events, and serialization (95%+ coverage)
- **SceneManager**: 21 tests for 3D scene setup, lighting, camera management, and object lifecycle (91%+ coverage)  
- **SaveSystem**: 16 tests for game persistence, save slots, error handling, and data integrity (55%+ coverage)

Testing framework:
- **Jest** with TypeScript support via ts-jest
- **jsdom** environment for DOM testing
- **Three.js mocks** to avoid WebGL dependencies in tests
- **Coverage reporting** with HTML and LCOV output

Run `npm run test:coverage` to see detailed coverage reports.

### Code Quality
The project uses ESLint for code quality and TypeScript for type safety. All code is thoroughly documented and follows consistent patterns.

### Deployment
The game is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The deployment workflow:
- Builds the project on every push to the main branch
- Creates a production build with proper asset paths
- Deploys to GitHub Pages at [https://jikaheimo.github.io/copilot-rpg/](https://jikaheimo.github.io/copilot-rpg/)
